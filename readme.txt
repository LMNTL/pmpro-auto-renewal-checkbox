Make auto renewal optional at checkout with a checkbox.

== Description ==

Adds an option to PMPro membership levels: Auto Renewal Optional. If set and a recurring billing amount is present, a checkbox is added to the checkout page to optional enable auto renewal.

This does not work with PMPro discount codes yet. If a customer uses a discount code, the auto renewal checkbox will be ignored and the default recurring billing settings from the discount code will be used.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-auto-renewal-checkbox` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Edit your membership levels and set the "Auto Renewal" options for each level.
